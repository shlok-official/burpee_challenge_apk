## Installation and Editing instructions

`Hi Kyle,`
`please install both the APK's and use the **GREEN** icon of "NUMAD-BURPEE CHALLENGE". My main app had 5 seperate exciting apps. Burpee challenge which was out final assignment was to be opened by clicking the separate icon(GREEN COLOR) which is installed outside of the main app.`

This complete Android Studio project makes up an Android mobile application which contains multiple projects intergrated as one app. This one app contains the `Burpee Challenge app` and `the Scraggle game.`

The application can be used diretly by installing the `'shlok-app-release.apk'` .

Upon installing the app creates two icons on phone. 
* The first icon named 'NUMAD16S-ShlokDixit' contains the full application along with a button 'Final Project' on home screen to invoke the Burpee Challenge application. 
* The second icon titled 'MAD16S-BurpeeChallenge' on phone invokes the Burpee Challenge application directly.
