## Installation and Editing instructions

`Hi Kyle and Phil,`
`**LATEST UPDATE** as on March 2 1:42 AM : just the single APK file works. I request you to download and check it out. Apologies for inconvenience. I created a  separate APK-removed the second APK dependency- fixed some bugs `

This complete Android Studio project makes up an Android mobile application which contains multiple projects intergrated as one app. This one app contains the `Burpee Challenge app` and `the Scraggle game.`

The application can be used diretly by installing the `'shlok-app-release.apk'` .

Upon installing the app creates two icons on phone. 
* The first icon named 'NUMAD16S-ShlokDixit' contains the full application along with a button 'Final Project' on home screen to invoke the Burpee Challenge application. 
* The second icon titled 'MAD16S-BurpeeChallenge' on phone invokes the Burpee Challenge application directly.
